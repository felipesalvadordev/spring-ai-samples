# Spring AI Samples 

A demonstration project showcasing Retrieval Augmented Generation (RAG) implementation using Spring AI and OpenAI's GPT models. This application enables intelligent document querying by combining the power of Large Language Models (LLMs) with local document context.  
And a demonstration of chat memory using MessageChatMemoryAdvisor.
## Overview

This project demonstrates how to:
- Ingest PDF documents into a vector database
- Perform semantic searches using Spring AI
- Augment LLM responses with relevant document context
- Create an API endpoint for document-aware chat interactions
- Build a ChatClient with a MessageChatMemoryAdvisor that uses InMemoryChatMemory. This setup allows our chatbot to remember previous interactions.
